The gateway provides a single endpoint for clients, and helps to decouple clients from services.</p><p>Gateway Aggregation. Use the gateway to aggregate multiple individual requests into a single request. This pattern applies when a single operation requires calls to multiple backend services. The client sends one request to the gateway. The gateway dispatches requests to the various backend services, and then aggregates the results and sends them back to the client. This helps to reduce chattiness between the client and the backend.</p><p>Gateway Offloading. Use the gateway to offload functionality from individual services to the gateway, particularly cross-cutting concerns. It can be useful to consolidate these functions into one place, rather than making every service responsible for implementing them. This is particularly true for features that requires specialized skills to implement correctly, such as authentication and authorization.</p><p>Here are some examples of functionality that could be offloaded to a gateway:<ul><li>SSL termination</li><li>Authentication</li><li>IP whitelisting</li><li>Client rate limiting (throttling)</li><li>Logging and monitoring</li><li>Response caching</li><li>Web application firewall</li><li>GZIP compression</li><li>Servicing static content</li></ul></p>",

The latter offers a much better user interface experience to its users that includes features like the drag-and-drop functionality that can be achieved without any code. Instead of hiring a Salesforce developer to create a Salesforce page or modify it, the page components can easily be rearranged by an admin according to their liking. <br>Furthermore, Lightning helps in toning down the need for Visualforce for every task. The codes that are created during any kind of development need to be tested and then deployed. In case of missed bugs, the code is sent back to the developer to fix and the process starts over again. But with the help of Salesforce Lightning, these types of tedious processes can be avoided. <br>Lightning does not mean that companies donâ€™t need Visualforce developers anymore. Lightning provides a helping hand to the developers by moving minor customization tasks to the admins, which allows developers to focus on larger Salesforce app development projects.</li><li><b>Higher Security:</b> With Salesforce Lightning comes enhanced security. For instance, LockerService is a feature that separates Lightning components for them to interact with each other. This helps in safeguarding the platform from malicious data. No such feature can be found in the Classic mode.<br>Permissions, too, work quite distinctly in Salesforce Lightning. The platform does not allow users to raise their assurance levels, say from standard to high, in-session. For that, they will have to log out of the Lightning platform and sign in again with authentication with a higher assurance level.</li><li><b>Einstein (Wave) Analytics:</b> While an enhanced and upgraded user interface and security are the points strong enough for the comparison, Salesforce Lightning also provides users with access to Einstein (Wave) Analytics reporting, which the Classic does not. For creating graphs, charts, and lists, the Salesforce Classic reports depend on standard reporting types. At the time the data is refreshed, these dashboards prove to be a great option for capturing a view of important metrics.<br>When we talk about Einstein Analytics, it is a whole different deal. The platform carries its own database that is fetched from Salesforce and updates each hour automatically. Also, the dashboard displays the most recent, refreshed data.</li><li><b>Progressive platform:</b> In its initial days, Lightning was looked down at because of its transition and compatibility issues with objects, custom code, and apps. But gone are those days, and the platform has evolved with the ability to support all custom metadata objects, making it a lot simpler for companies to transition their existing apps and workflows with no requirements of building from scratch.</li><li><b>Hassle-free Lead Generation: </b>Although Salesforce Classic enables you to create leads, the Lightning Experience offers more components in order to manage sales processes better. For instance, the Activity timeline in the Lightning mode allows users to identify whatâ€™s been achieved for a specific lead and presents the details of every meeting, task, or call. The Path component enables the tracking of various stages involved in the business process, whereas, the News component offers updates about the leads on time.</li></ol></p>",

Features should be developed within a single release, but can live beyond releases and sprints.</p>",
